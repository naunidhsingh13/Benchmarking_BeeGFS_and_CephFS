Benchmarking Storage Access Patterns – BeeGFS and CephFS

Aim of the project is to implement and assess performance comparisons and evaluate system overheads between two PFSs: BeeGFS and CephFS using multiple file systems – XFS, EXT4, BTRFS with different configurations and provide detailed analysis.

Please refer to document - Benchmarking_Ceph_And_BeeGFS.pdf for detailed analysis.
